# agentmanager

Managing application for the Issuer, Verifier and Status-list agents.

The Agent Manager enables the user to address the administration API of the Issuer, Verifier and Status-List agents used in the EduWallet project. The tool runs completely front-end, using the local browser storage to retain the administrative API token. It interfaces with the remote agents using the relevant APIs on those agents.
